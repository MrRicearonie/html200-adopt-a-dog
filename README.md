# Adopt A Dog Website Assignment

## Description
Adopt A Dog is the course project for UW's HTML5200 class. In this project, we created a website to match mochup pictures that were provided. We then implemented responisive web techniques, JavaScript, and JQuery to make our site viewable on almost any device, while adding interactive elements.

Adopt A Dog features a home page with 6 dogs and, if screen size allows, preview to the blog content. There is a page for all of the dogs that are avalible to adopt with a picture and some information about them. There is also a blog that contains blog posts about being a dog owner, aswell as a checkout page to adopt the dogs.

## Testing
I wanted to test on the most devices I possible could. To do this I used a combination of the following:

*Operating Systems*
| OS | Computer |
| ------- | -------|
| MacOS 12 | 2021 MacBook Pro 14"|
| Windows 10 | 2018 Desktop with Ultrawide screen |
| Ubuntu | 2018 Desktop with Ultrawide screen | 
| iOS 14 | iPhone 8 |
| iOS 15 | iPhone Xr | 
| Android 11 | Nokia 2.3 | 

*Browsers*
- Safari
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Opera
- Brave
- iOS Safari
- Chrome for Android

In testing, everything worked as expected except for one alignment issue on iOS Safari, and one button didn't show a pointer for the cursor.
