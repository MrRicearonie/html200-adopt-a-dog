What was found in testing 
-------------------------

While testing on each device, I found that there was only a couple of things that were not working
properly. On every device the submit form button did not have a cursor value set so it now has been
changed to show a pointer when hovering over it to indicate that you can click it. The only other
issue that was found is in iOS Safari, the drop down to select which state you live in is not
correct. It is aligned to the left and not centered like in every other browser when of same size.
